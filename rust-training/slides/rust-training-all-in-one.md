###### (Source: [Memory Safety Issues Are Still the Leading Source of Security Vulnerabilities](https://blogs.grammatech.com/memory-safety-issues-are-still-the-leading-source-of-security-vulnerabilities))

---

## Safety is hard!

- memory safety is not easy (you need to understand the corner cases)
- conccurency safety is really hard (without certain tradeoffs)
- Often you have to bear the extra layer of abstractions
  - normally it means performance hit

---

## Memory safety

- Manually - C/C++: painful and error-prone
- Smart Pointers - C++/ObjC/Swift: be aware of cyclical references
- GC - Java/DotNet/Erlang: mubch bigger memory consumption, and STW
- Ownership - Rust: learning curve

---

## Concurrency safety

- single-threaded - Javascript: cannot leverage multicore
- GIL - Python/Ruby: multithreading is notorious inefficient
- Actor model - Erlang/Akka: at the cost of memory copy and heap allocation
- CSP - Golang: at the cost of memory copy and heap allocation
- Ownership + Type System - Rust: super _elegant_ and _no extra cost_!

## Recap

<style scoped>
h5 {font-size: 20px; margin-top: 0px;}
h6 {font-size: 18px; margin-top: 40px;}
</style>

- One and only one owner
- Multiple immutable references
- mutable reference is mutual exclsive
- Reference cannot outlive owner
- _use type safety for thread safety_

###### With these simple rules, Rust achieved safety with

## Things built with Rust

![height:400px](images/built_with_rust.jpg)

---

## Should I use Rust?

- Rust is ideal when you need a system that reliable and performant
- Sometimes you don't, sometimes you do, sometimes you need that later
- it's all about tradeoffs

---

## Rust for our use cases

- parts of the system that are bottlenecks
  - bottleneck on computation
  - bottleneck on memory consumption
  - bootleneck on I/O
- parser/decoder/encoder
- wants to leverage existingC/C++/Rust ecosystem (e.g. you need blake3 for hashing)

## Rust FFI

## Learning rust as a(n)...

- Elixir eng: ownership model, type system, oh no mutation
- Scala eng: ownership model, oh no mutation
- Typescript eng: ownership model, multi-threaded programming
- Swift/Java eng: ownership model
- Python eng: ownership model, type system

---

## The common misunderstandings

---

### 1. Rust is super hard to learn...

![height:500px](images/rust_learning_curve.png)

---

### Rust is explicit

- Lots of knowledge about computer science is suddenly explicit to you
- If all your pain to learn a lang is 100%:
  - Rust:
    - Compiler help to reduce that to 90%
    - Then you suffer 70% the pains in first 3-6 months
    - Then the rest 20% in 3-5 years
  - Other:
    - You suffer 10-30% in first 3-6 months
    - Then 70%-90% in next 3-5 years
---

### 2. Unsafe Rust is evil...

## Ownership, borrow check, and lifetime

---

### Ownership/Borrow Rules Review

![height:500px](images/ownership.jpg)

---

## Lifetime, not a new idea

---

#### Lifetime: Stack memory

```c
#include <stdio.h>
static int VALUE = 42;

void world(char *st, int num) {
    printf("%s(%d)\n", st, num);
}


void hello(int num) {
    char *st = "hello world";
    int v = VALUE+num;
    world(st, v);
}

int main() {
    hello(2);
}

```

![bg right fit](images/stack_lifetime.jpg)

---

#### Lifetime: Heap memory (tracing GC)

![bg  right:60% fit](images/tracing_gc.jpg)

---

#### Lifetime: Heap memory (ARC)

![bg right:65% fit](images/arc.png)

---

## How Rust handles lifetime?

---

### Move semantics

---

![bg fit](images/rust_memory.jpg)


---

### What a bout Borrow?

Think about: why does this work in Rust, but not C/C++?

---

![bg fit](images/rust_memory_ref.jpg)

---

#### Rust lifetime checker prevents this...

![height:500px](images/borrow_cross_threads.jpg)

---

### Benefit of lifetime-constrained borrow

- can borrow anything (stack object, heap object)
- safety can be guaranteed at compile-time (no runtime lifetime bookkeeping)
- Rust borrow checker is mostly a lifetime checker

---

### Lifetime Annotation

- similar as generics, but in lowercase starting with `'`
- only need to put annotation when there's conflicts

```rust
// need explicit lifetime
struct User<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
    ...
}
fn process<T, 'a, 'b>(item1: &'a T, item2: &'b T) {}

// &'a User could be written as &User since on confliction
fn lifetime_example(user: &User) { // --+ Lifetime 'a
    if user.is_authed() {          //   |--+ Lifetime 'b
        let role = user.roles();   //   |  |
                                   //   |  |--+ Lifetime 'c
        verify(&role);             //   |  |  |
                                   //   |  |--+
    }                              //   |--+
}                                  // --+

fn verify(x: &Role) { /*...*/ }
```

---

### Static Lifetime

- 'static
- data included in bss / data / text section
  - constants / static variables
  - string literals
  - functions
- if used as trait bound:
  - the type does not contain any non-static references
  - owned data always passes a `'static` lifetime bound, but reference to the owned data does not

---

## Thread spawn

<style scoped>
    p { font-size: 24px; }
</style>

```rust
pub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>
where
    F: FnOnce() -> T,
    F: Send + 'static,
    T: Send + 'static,
{
    Builder::new().spawn(f).expect("failed to spawn thread")
}
```

The 'static constraint is a way of saying, roughly, that no borrowed data is permitted in the closure.

---

### RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

- initializing the object will also make sure resource is initialized
- releasing the object will also make sure resource is released

---

### Drop Trait

- memory
- file
- socket
- lock
- any other OS resources

---

## demo

---

![bg fit](images/strtok.jpg)

---

## Mental model

- write the code and defer the complexity about ensuring the code is safe/correct
- comfront the most of the safety/correctness problems upfront
- Mutate can only happen when you own the data, or you have a mutable reference
  - either way, the thread is guaranteed to be the only one with access at a time
- Fearless Refactoring
- reinforce properties well-behaved software exhibits
- sometimes too strict: rust isn't dogmatic about enforcing it

## Cost of defects

- Don't introduce defect (this is impossible because humans are fallible).
- Detect and correct defect as soon as the bad key press occurs (within reason: you don't want the programmer to lose too much flow) (milliseconds later).
- At next build / test time (seconds or minutes later).
- When code is shared with others (maybe you push a branch and CI tells you something is wrong) (minutes to days later).
- During code review (minutes to days later).
- When code is integrated (e.g. merged) (minutes to days later).
- When code is deployed (minutes to days or even months later).
- When a bug is reported long after the code has been deployed (weeks to years later).

---

## Ownership and Borrow rules

- Use after free: no more (reference can't point to dropped value)
- Buffer underruns, overflows, illegal memory access: no more (reference must be valid and point to owned value)
- memory level data races: no more (single writer or multiple readers)

---

## Trait (Typeclass)

---

![bg fit](images/rust_trait1.jpg)

---

### Trait Object

- Unlike java, you can't assign a value to a trait (no implicit reference!!!)
- trait object is a fat pointer (automatically converted)
  - normal pointer reference to the value
  - vtable (vtable pointer)
    - unlike C++/Java, it is not a ptr in struct
- dynamic dispatch

## Generics

---

### History of Generic Programming

![width:1200px](images/why_generics.jpg)

(from: [Fundamentals of Generic Programming](http://stepanovpapers.com/DeSt98.pdf))

---

### Classification of Abstractions

- _Data Abstractions_: data types and sets of operations defined on them
  - e.g. `Vec<T>`, `HashMap<K, V>`
- _Algorithmic abstrations_: families of data abstractions that have a set of efficient algorithms in common (generic algorithms)
  - e.g. `quicksort`, `binary_search`
- _Structural abstractions_: a data abstraction A belongs to a structural abstraction S if and only if S is an intersection of some of the algorithmic abstractions to which A belongs.
  - e.g. singly-linked-lists
- _Representational abstractions_: mappings from one structural abstration to another, creating a new type and implementing a set of operations on that type.
  - e.g. `VecDeque<T>`
- Comes from: Generic Programming: http://stepanovpapers.com/genprog.pdf

---

### _Generics_ to __Types__

## Why not object oriented?

---

### Class is awesome

![bg left fit](images/classes.png)

- Encapsulation
- Access control
- Abstraction
- Namespace
- Extensibility

---

### Class has problems

- inheritance is pretty limited - choose superclass well!
- know what/how to override (and when not to)
- superclass may have properties
  - you have to accept it
  - initialization burden
  - don't break assumptions of superclass
- hard to reuse outside the hierachy (composition over inheritance)

---

## Concurrency - primitives

---

## Let's solve a real-world problem

---

### v1: Simple loop

![height:400px](images/concurrency-1.png)

---

### v2: Multithread with shared state

![height:400px](images/concurrency-2.png)

---

### v3: Optimize the lock

![height:400px](images/concurrency-3.png)

---

### v4: Share memory by communicating

![height:400px](images/concurrency-4.png)

---

### v5: Async Task

![height:400px](images/concurrency-5.jpg)

---

## What have we used so far?

- Mutex Lock
- Channel/Actor
- Async Task (coroutine, promise, etc.)

---

## How is Mutex implemented?

---

### An naive implementation

```Rust
struct Lock<T> {
  locked: bool,
  data: T,
}

impl<T> Lock<T> {
  pub fn new(data: T) -> Lock<T> { ... }

  pub fn lock<R>(&mut self, op: impl FnOnce(&mut T) -> R) -> R {
    // spin if we can't get lock
    while self.locked != false {} // **1
    // ha, we can lock and do our job
    self.locked = true; // **2
    // execute the op as we got lock
    let ret = op(self.data); // **3
    // unlock
    self.locked = false; // **4
    ret
  }
}

// You may call it like this:
let l = Lock::new(0);
l.lock(|v| v += 1);
```

---

### Issues

- Atomicity
  - In multicore environment, race condition between 1 and 2 - other thread may kick in
  - Even in single core environment, OS may do preempted multitasking, causing other thread kick in
- OOO execution
  - Compiler might generate optimized instructions that put 3 before 1
  - CPU may do OOO execution to best utilize pipeline, so putting 3 before 1 might also happen

---

### How to solve this?

- We need CPU instruction to guarantee Atomicity and non-OOO
- Algorithm: _CAS (Compare-And-Swap)_
- data structure: `AtomicXXX`

---

## Atomics

---

### Updated lock

```Rust
struct Lock<T> {
  locked: AtomicBool, // ***
  data: UnsafeCell<T>, // ***
}
unsafe impl<T> Sync for Lock<T> where T: Send {} // need to explicitly impl `Send`

impl<T> Lock<T> {
  pub fn new(data: T) -> Self { ... }
  pub fn lock<R>(&mut self, op: impl FnOnce(&mut T) -> R) -> R {
    // spin if we can't get lock
    while self
      .locked
      .compare_exchange(false, true, Ordering::Acquire, Ordering::Relaxed)
      .is_error() {}
    // execute the op as we got lock
    let ret = op(unsafe { &mut *self.v.get() }); // **3
    // unlock
    self.locked.store(false, Ordering::Release); // **4
    ret
  }
}

// You may call it like this:
let l = Lock::new(0);
l.lock(|v| v += 1);
```

---

### What does ordering mean?

- Relaxed: No restriction to compiler/CPU, OOO is allowed
- Release:
  - for current thread, any read/write inst cannot be OOO after this inst (`store`);
  - for other thread, if they use `Acquire` to read, they would see the changed value
- Acquire
  - for current thread, any read/write inst cannot be OOO before this inst (`compare_exchange`)
  - for other thread, if they use `Release` to update data, the modification would be see for current thread
- AcqRel: combination of Acquire and Release
- SeqCst: besides `AcqRel`, all threads would see same operation order.

---

### Optimization

```Rust

pub struct Lock<T> {
    locked: AtomicBool,
    data: UnsafeCell<T>,
}
unsafe impl<T> Sync for Lock<T> where T: Send {}

impl<T> Lock<T> {
  pub fn new(data: T) -> Self {...}
  pub fn lock<R>(&self, op: impl FnOnce(&mut T) -> R) -> R {
      while self
          .locked
          .compare_exchange(false, true, Ordering::Acquire, Ordering::Relaxed)
          .is_err()
      {
          while self.locked.load(Ordering::Relaxed) == true {
              std::thread::yield_now(); // we may yield thread now
          }
      }
      let ret = op(unsafe { &mut *self.data.get() });
      self.locked.store(false, Ordering::Release);
      ret
  }
}
```

#### This is basically how

## Mutex

#### works

---

### Real world Mutex

![height:400px](images/concurrency-mutex.png)

---

## Semaphore

---

> In computer science, a _semaphore_ is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example, incremented or decremented, or toggled) depending on programmer-defined conditions.
>
> A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in a real-world system is as __a record of how many units of a particular resource are available__, coupled with operations to adjust that record safely (i.e., to avoid race conditions) as units are acquired or become free, and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.

---

### Semaphore as a generalized Mutex

![height:400px](images/concurrency-semaphore.jpg)

---

### Demo code: restricted HTTP client

[code/primitives/src/http_semaphore.rs](https://github.com/tyrchen/rust-training/blob/master/code/primitives/src/http_semaphore.rs)

---

## Channel

---

### Channel basics

![height:400px](images/concurrency-channel.jpg)

---

### Flavours of Channels

- sync: sender can block, limited capacity
  - `Mutex` + `Condvar` + `VecDeque`
  - Atomic VecDeque (atomic queue) + `thread::park` + `thread::notify`
- async: sender cannot block, unbounded
  - `Mutex` + `Condvar` + `VecDeque`
  - `Mutex` + `Condvar` + `DoubleLinkedList`
- rendezvous: sync with capacity = 0. Used for thread sync.
  - `Mutex` + `Condvar`
- oneshot: only one call to `send()`. e.g. Ctrl+C to stop all threads
  - atomic swap
- async/await
  - basically same as sync but waker is different

---

### Demo code: naive MPSC

[code/primitives/src/channel.rs](https://github.com/tyrchen/rust-training/blob/master/code/primitives/src/channel.rs)

---

### Demo code: naive actor

- Questions:
  - Which type of channel shall we use? SPSC, SPMC, MPSC?
  - When creating an actor, what is its `pid`?
  - When sending a message to an actor, how the actor reply (`handle_call`)?
- Code: [code/primitives/src/actor.rs](https://github.com/tyrchen/rust-training/blob/master/code/primitives/src/actor.rs)

### Things to do with atomics

- lock free data structure
- in memory metrics
- id generation

---

## Concurrency - async/await

---

### Using threads in Rust

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    println!("So we start the program here!");
    let t1 = thread::spawn(move || {
        thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(200));
        println!("We create tasks which gets run when they're finished!");
    });

    let t2 = thread::spawn(move || {
        thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
        println!("We can even chain callbacks...");
        let t3 = thread::spawn(move || {
            thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(50));
            println!("...like this!");
        });
        t3.join().unwrap();
    });
    println!("While our tasks are executing we can do other stuff here.");

    t1.join().unwrap();
    t2.join().unwrap();
}

```

---

### Drawbacks of threads

- large stack (not suitable for heavy loaded concurrent jobs - e.g. a web server)
- context switch is out of your control
- lots of syscall involved (costly when # of threads is high)

---

### What are alternative solutions?

---

## Green threads/processes

### (stackful coroutine)

#### Golang/Erlang

---

### Green Threads

- Run some non-blocking code.
- Make a blocking call to some external resource.
- CPU "jumps" to the "main" thread which schedules a different thread to run and "jumps" to that stack.
- Run some non-blocking code on the new thread until a new blocking call or the task is finished.
- CPU "jumps" back to the "main" thread, schedules a new thread which is ready to make progress, and "jumps" to that thread.

---

### Green Threads - pros/cons

- Pros:
  - Simple to use. The code will look like it does when using OS threads.
  - A "context switch" is reasonably fast.
  - Each stack only gets a little memory to start with so you can have hundreds of thousands of green threads running.
  - It's easy to incorporate preemption which puts a lot of control in the hands of the runtime implementors.
- Cons:
  - The stacks might need to grow. Solving this is not easy and will have a cost.
  - You need to save the CPU state on every switch.
  - It's not a zero cost abstraction (Rust had green threads early on and this was one of the reasons they were removed).
  - Complicated to implement correctly if you want to support many different platforms.

---

## Poll based event loops

### (stackless coroutine)

#### Javascript/Rust

---

### Callback

![bg left fit](images/js_runtime.png)

```js
setTimer(200, () => {
  setTimer(100, () => {
    setTimer(50, () => {
      console.log("I'm the last one");
    });
  });
});
```

---

![bg left fit](images/promise.jpg)

### Promise

```js
function timer(ms) {
    return new Promise(
      (resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms)
    );
}

timer(200)
.then(() => timer(100))
.then(() => timer(50))
.then(() => console.log("I'm the last one"));
```

### Async/Await

```js
async function run() {
    await timer(200);
    await timer(100);
    await timer(50);
    console.log("I'm the last one");
}
  ```

### Demo: Build a TCP server (sync/async)

deps: stdlib / tokio

---

### Demo: HTTP Client/Server

deps: reqwest / actix-web

---

### Demo: gRPC

deps: prost / tonic

---

### Steps to write a server

- data serialization: serde / protobuf / flatbuffer / capnp / etc.
- transport protocol: tcp / http / websocket / quic / etc.
- security layer: TLS / noise protocol / secio / etc.
- application layer: your own application logic

## FFI with C/Elixir/Swift/Java

---

### Why do we need cross-lang interoperatability?

- Use the right tool for the right problem
- (For Rust) We may want to leverage C/++ libraries
- (For other lang) We may want to bring Rust ecosystem to solve the problem
  - e.g. elixir doesn't have a good lib to generate cert, so we leverage `rcgen` from Rust
- (For other lang) We may want to improve the performance for certain use cases
  - e.g. use rust to do computation intensive job in Python
- avoid building same logic in multiple platforms

---

### Rust to use C

```Rust
extern crate libc;
use libc::size_t;

#[link(name = "snappy")]
extern "C" {
    fn snappy_max_compressed_length(source_length: size_t) -> size_t;
}

fn main() {
    let len = 10000;
    let result = unsafe { snappy_max_compressed_length(len) };
    println!("max compressed length for {} byte buffer: {}", len, result);
}
```

### Elixir: Rustler

```rust
#[rustler::nif]
fn eval(policy: &str, app: &str, country: &str, platform: &str) -> bool {
    eval_policy(policy, app, country, platform)
}

rustler::init!("Elixir.PolicyEngine.Nif", [eval]);
```

##### Rustler version: 0.22.0-rc.1

---

### Python: PyO3

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::wrap_pyfunction;

#[pyfunction]
fn num_cpus() -> PyResult<usize> {
    Ok(num_cpus::get())
}

#[pymodule]
fn rust_utils(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(num_cpus, m)?)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

---

### Nodejs: neon

```rust
use neon::prelude::*;

fn hello(mut cx: FunctionContext) -> JsResult<JsString> {
    Ok(cx.string("hello node"))
}

fn num_cpus(mut cx: FunctionContext) -> JsResult<JsNumber> {
    Ok(cx.number(num_cpus::get() as f64))
}

#[neon::main]
fn main(mut cx: ModuleContext) -> NeonResult<()> {
    cx.export_function("hello", hello)?;
    cx.export_function("num_cpus", num_cpus)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

---

### Java: robusta

```rust
use robusta_jni::bridge;
use robusta_jni::convert::Signature;

#[bridge]
mod jni {
    #[derive(Signature)]
    #[package(com.example.hello)]
    struct HelloWorld;

    impl HelloWorld {
        pub extern "jni" fn special(mut input1: Vec<i32>, input2: i32) -> Vec<String> {
            input1.push(input2);
            input1.iter().map(ToString::to_string).collect()
        }
    }
}
```


---

### Things to consider

- Avoiding throwing panics over the FFI (which is undefined behavior)
- Translating rust errors (and panics) into errors that the caller on the other side of the FFI is able to handle
- Converting strings to/from rust str
- Passing non-string data back and forth between Rust and whatever the caller on the other side of the FFI is.
  - use the data structure conversion methods in target language (e.g. `repr(C)`)
  - serialized with JSON / protobuf / flatbuffer / etc. (just like js-bridge!)
